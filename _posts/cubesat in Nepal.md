CubeSats (Cubical Satellites) could hold the key to Nepalâ€™s future development of natural disaster prevention systems. 
These satellites were first launched in United States of America back in the end of 20th Century.
Since CubeSats can be developed at low-cost and within a very short time frame, it is possible that continuous surveillance system can be established to check on the natural and anthropogenic disasters such as Earthquake, Monsoon Floods, Draught and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods economically.
